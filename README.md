# OptimaList

A grocery list generator based on saved recipes and ingredients

Optimalist is made to help make grocery shopping easier and more efficient. 
Whenever you find a recipe you want to make, oftentimes you will have to go shopping 
for just the ingredients of that recipe, which can be wasteful and expensive, since you 
will have to buy many of the ingredients in larger quantity than the recipe calls for or 
buying ingredients in smaller quantity will cost more. You can add as many recipes as 
you want to Optimalist and then when you are ready to go shopping, the app will 
generate a shopping list that combines common ingredients between recipes to 
produce the smallest list of ingredients that can make the largest number of recipes.
